My own little project:
Combining my teaching experience with programming, I created a fun little text-based game for kids to pracice English grammar.
The player first sets up a nickname, then tries to find their way through a maze, bumping into grammar exersices on the way that they must complete.
The player has 3 tries to get each exercise right. If they fail, the game is over.
The exercises have different variants so that the player, when (or if) they play again, doesn't have to do the same exrcise twice.
After successfully getting through the maze, a timer shows the player their score and asks, if they want to try again.
The game will slowly be expanding, as I plan on adding more exercises, make the maze bigger, connect it with a database for player scores, and give it a JavaFX upgrade:)
